# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `n8n_diff_workflow` - read-only semantic diff between a workflow's current state and a snapshot. Inputs: `id` plus exactly one of `snapshotPath` (absolute file path; `~` resolved) or `snapshot` (inline object). Snapshot accepts both shapes: flat (`n8n_save_workflow` / `n8n_delete_workflow` backup) and nested (`n8n_get_workflow(includeDefinition=true)`). Returns counters in `summary` (added/removed/modified/nameChanged/connectionsChanged/settingsChanged) plus a `diff` payload with per-node `fieldsChanged` paths walking one level into `parameters` (e.g. `parameters.command`, `parameters.url`). Node matching is two-pass: id-first, name-fallback — handles legacy/hand-edited snapshots without forcing a "1 added + 1 removed" false signal. Cosmetic-only changes (`position`, `webhookId`) suppressed by default; toggle with `ignoreCosmetic: false`. Per-node detail capped at `maxModifiedDetails` (default 50, max 500) with an explicit `nodesModifiedTruncated` flag; `summary` counters are uncapped.

### Notes
- Closes the snapshot/restore loop opened in 0.7/0.8: you could save and restore but had no way to see what changed between them. Pairs with `n8n_save_workflow` (which writes the snapshot) and `n8n_audit_browser_bridge_usage` (which surfaces calls — diff tells you whether they've drifted).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `n8n_audit_browser_bridge_usage` - read-only scanner that walks every workflow and surfaces nodes calling the [`browser-bridge`](https://github.com/solomonneas/browser-bridge) CLI (Execute Command, Code, SSH, legacy Function). Returns one finding per `(workflowId, nodeName, platform, action)` plus a per-platform action summary. Optional filters: `platform`, `action`, `activeOnly`, `includeArchived`. Paginates via cursor up to `maxWorkflows` (default 250, max 1000) with bounded-concurrency `getWorkflow` fan-out (default 3, max 8). Per-workflow fetch failures land in `fetchErrors` instead of failing the whole audit. Detection regex requires the `.js` / `.cjs` / `.mjs` extension to avoid false positives from path mentions like `cd /opt/browser-bridge`.
- `n8n_scaffold_browser_bridge_node` - pure local generator (no n8n API call) that emits a ready-to-paste n8n node calling `browser-bridge <platform> <action>`. Two modes: `code-node` (default; `spawnSync` with stdin JSON, surfaces `exitCode` + `stderr`) and `execute-command` (quoted `<<'JSON'` heredoc). Mirrors the patterns in browser-bridge's `docs/n8n-usage.md`. Validates `platform` and `action` as kebab slugs to keep them safe to interpolate into shell commands. Warns when `execute-command` mode is paired with non-empty `input` (heredoc bakes input in; no per-item wiring).

### Notes
- Companion repo: [browser-bridge](https://github.com/solomonneas/browser-bridge). The two new tools are the first n8n-ops-mcp pieces designed to compose with browser-bridge end-to-end (find existing calls, then scaffold new ones).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Reframed the README as MCP-first (any MCP-compatible client) while preserving the "built for OpenClaw" origin story and first-class plugin path.
- Refreshed package and plugin descriptions to cover the full workflow + execution lifecycle added in 0.7/0.8.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`.

No behavior changes. Docs and metadata only.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_create_workflow` - `POST /workflows`. Accepts `n8n_get_workflow(includeDefinition=true)` output directly, strips read-only fields, runs `validateWorkflow` as a pre-check. New workflow is created inactive. Primary restore path for `n8n_delete_workflow` snapshots (one-call restore).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_archive_workflow` - soft-delete. Reversible, preserves the original id, deactivates as a side effect.
- `n8n_unarchive_workflow` - restore an archived workflow. Does NOT reactivate triggers.
- `n8n_delete_workflow` - permanent delete. Confirm-gated, snapshots to `backupDir` before the DELETE; aborts if the snapshot can't be written. Restore via `n8n_create_workflow`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_delete_executions` - batch form of delete-execution. Client-side fan-out with bounded concurrency (default 3, max 10), capped at 50 ids, confirm-gated. 404 per id is treated as `already_deleted` (idempotent). A 5xx on any id aborts the batch via an `AbortController` - no new ids claimed and in-flight requests cancelled client-side. Best-effort, not transactional.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Consolidated per-test `createFakeClient` copies into a shared fake-fetch harness (`tests/helpers/fake-fetch.ts`).
- Added `N8nClient` wire-shape coverage so any drift from n8n's REST contract is caught at the HTTP boundary.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_delete_execution` - `DELETE /executions/{id}`. Confirm-gated, irreversible. Returns `ok: false` with `reason: "not_found"` on 404.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_retry_execution` - `POST /executions/{id}/retry`. Creates a NEW execution and surfaces both `originalExecutionId` and `newExecutionId`. Optional `loadWorkflow: true` retries against the currently saved workflow.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_cancel_execution` - `POST /executions/{id}/stop`. Closes the triage loop after `n8n_search_executions` locates a stuck run.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `n8n_search_executions` - text-search recent executions for an error fragment. Defaults to scanning `status=error` payloads; `scope: "all"` also greps per-node run data.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `openclaw.build.{openclawVersion,pluginSdkVersion}` in `package.json` for ClawHub publish metadata.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` in `package.json` for ClawHub publish.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Initial release. Read-only ops tools: `n8n_list_workflows`, `n8n_get_workflow`, `n8n_list_executions`, `n8n_get_execution`, `n8n_list_webhooks`, `n8n_validate_workflow`, `n8n_trigger`.
- Edit tools behind `enableEdit`: `n8n_activate`, `n8n_deactivate`, `n8n_save_workflow` (auto-backup + validation gate).
- MCP stdio wrapper so the plugin runs in any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Hermes Agent).
- Built as a first-class OpenClaw plugin (shared gateway process, auth profiles, hooks).
